MySolarPlant is Web Based Application for creating solar power plants profiles. 
You can add solar plant equipment, combine it solar plant unit and from your own unit you can create solar power plant.
The users in the app can have three kinds of roles: 
    admin - has permissions to do everything
    engineer - can add equipment (pv panels, inverters, charge controllers, batteries)
             - can create power units and power plants
    user - can create power units and power plants from pre-added equipment 
         - can preview it's own units and plants.

The main purpose of Solar Unit is to combine equipment that is compatible. 
The Solar Power Plant can be created from one or more Solar Units.

Currently the database is MySQL but i'm planning to add Non-relational DB for implementing data acquisition functionality.
